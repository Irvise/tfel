It refers to the **current development sources**, instructions for
specific released versions are included with the sources and detailled
in the `INSTALL` and the `INSTALL-cmake` files located at the root
directory of the sources).

This document describes the generic installation procedure for `TFEL`
from the sources on posix-compliant systems. Please note that the main
systems on which `TFEL` was developed is `Linux`. Extensive testing on
other posix-compliant operating systems, notably `FreeBSD`, is
lacking, although compilation and unit testing is known to work. A
page dedicated to `FreeBSD` is available [here](install-freebsd.html).

The installation on [Windows plateform](http://windows.microsoft.com)
is described in the following pages:

- [Installation based on `cmake` and `Visual Studio`](install-windows-VisualStudio.html).
- [Installation based on `cmake` and `MinGW` (as packaged with `Cast3M` `2017`)](install-windows-Cast3M2017.html). This
  tutorial can easily be adapted to other versions of `MinGW`, without
  requiring `Cast3M` to be installed.
- [Installation based on `MSYS`](install-windows-msys.html).

The creation of binary packages are detailled [here](packages.html). 

A quick way of installing `TFEL` on `Ubuntu` systems is given in Section
@sec:QuickUbuntu.

`TFEL` is known to work on standard architectures implemented by the
Intel and AMD processors, either 32 or 64 bits. As no specific
instructions relative to the underlying architecture is used in the
code, other architectures shall work as well.

If you have `cmake` (version greater than \(2.8\)) installed on your
system, installing Ì€TFEL` basically boils down to the following
simple commands:

~~~~ {#building1 .bash}
$ cmake [options]
$ make 
$ make install
~~~~

If you do not have `cmake`, you can use the standard procedure

~~~~ {#building2 .bash}
$ configure [options]
$ make 
$ make install
~~~~

The optional parameters of `cmake` and `configure` allows you to:

- specify the source location
- specify the installation directory
- *specify the interfaces to be build*

The rest of this document is dedicated to giving all the details
related to the installation process. For completeness, we will broke
the installation procedure into five steps:

- Checking for available prerequisites
- Downloading the source
- Configuration
- Building
- Testing (optional)
- Final install

# Prerequisites

## Compilers 

`TFEL` version 2.0 requires a `C++-98` compliant compiler, a `C`
compiler and optionally a `fortran` compiler. The following compilers
suite are officially supported:

- [The GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/). This is the
  default on most Linux distributions and is used for the development
  of `TFEL`. Most versions starting from gcc 3.4 have been tested
  successfully, although versions prior to 4.4 are less and less used.
- [The `clang` C and C++ compilers](http://clang.llvm.org/). All
  versions starting from 3.3 have been tested successfully.
- The
  [Intel compilers suite](https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers).
  All versions starting from 11.0 have been tested successfully.

## Third party libraries

`TFEL` has been designed to have no dependencies to third parties
libraries to the very exception of the
[Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org) library used to create the
optional bindings for the [`Python`](https://www.python.org/)
language.

## Third party tools


The better way to build the `TFEL` is to use the
[`cmake`](http://www.cmake.org/) build system (see this
[section](#using-the-cmake-build-system)). *We only support `cmake`
version greater than \(2.8\)*.

To build `TFEL` documentation, one may need:

- a valid [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) installation
  (reference manual in pdf format). The author uses the
  [texlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) distribution available with
  major Linux distributions.
- the [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) tool (code
  source documentation)

# Downloading the source

Official releases sources can be downloaded on
[`TFEL` sourceforge page](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tfel/files)
(see the Download entry of the navigation bar).

Sources of the development version are accessible through CEA svn
servers (see the
[Contributing](http://tfel.sourceforge.net/contributing.html) page for
details).

# Configuration

`TFEL` supports two build-systems:

- [`cmake`](http://www.cmake.org/) which is recommended.
- a `configure` script build upon the
  [GNU build system](http://www.gnu.org). This system is considered as
  deprecated and shall only be used if `cmake` is not available. Note
  that most unit tests will not be build.

## Creating a `build` directory

We highly recommend to use a separate directory to build the
sources.

In the following, we use the following convention:

- `$srcdir` points to the directory that actually contains the sources
  files.
- `$prefix` points to the final installation directory.

Both `$srcdir` and `$prefix` must contain an *absolute* path.

## Using the `cmake` build system

The use of the `cmake` build system is described in depth in the
`INSTALL-cmake` file that is located in the top directory of `TFEL`
sources. *We only support `cmake` version greater than \(2.8\)*, so
please check the version available on your system:

~~~~ {#cmake-version .bash}
$ cmake --version
~~~~

A typical usage of `cmake` is the following:

~~~~ {#building .bash}
$ cmake $srcdir -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Dlocal-castem-header=ON -Denable-fortran=ON -Denable-aster=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix
~~~~

This will build `TFEL` with the support of interfaces for the
[Cast3M](http://www-cast3m.cea.fr/) and
[Code-Aster](http://www.code-aster.org) finite element solvers.

Various other options can be passed to `cmake`:

- The option `-Denable-cyrano=ON` enables the interface for the
  `Cyrano3` fuel performance code.
- To enable the mechanical behaviour interface for the ZeBuLoN finite
  element solver, one may use the `-Denable-zmat=ON
  -DZSET_INSTALL_PATH=$ZSETPATH` option, where `$ZSETPATH` points to
  the installation directory of the ZeBuLoN finite element solver.
- To enable the material properties interface for the
  [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) language, one may use the
  `-Denable-python=ON` option.
- To enable bindings for the [`Python`](https://www.python.org/)
  language, notably for the `MTest` tool, one may use the
  `-Denable-python-bindings=ON` option. This requires the
  [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org) to be available.

Some default compiler settings are detected by `cmake`, depending on
your system. To explicitly specify the compilers to be used, one may
define one of the following variables:

- `CXX` : name of the `C++` compiler
- `CC`  : name of the `C` compiler
- `FC`  : name of the `fortran` compiler
- `F77` : name of the `fortran` compiler (77 standard)

For example, we can use the following command to select the
[Intel compilers suite](https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers):

~~~~ {#building-icpc .bash}
$ CXX=icpc CC=icc FC=ifort F77=ifort cmake $srcdir -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -Dlocal-castem-header=ON -Denable-fortran=ON -Denable-aster=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix
~~~~

### Controlling the generation of the documentation

Generation of the documentation can be controlled by the following options:

- `enable-doxygen-doc`,which enable the generation of the doxygen
  documentation (disabled by default)
- `disable-reference-doc`, which disable the reference documentation
  generation (enabled by default if `latex` of `pandoc` is found)
- `disable-website`, which disables the generation of the `TFEL`
  website (enabled by default if `pandoc` is found)

### Localisation of the libraries

Some `LiNuX` distributions install libraries in `lib64` on \(64\) bits
architectures and in `lib`. This can be changed by defining a
`LIB_SUFFIX` variable like this:

~~~~ {#lib-dir .bash}
$ cmake -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 ....
~~~~

### Appending the version number

The `TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` option will append the version number to the
names of:

- The executables.
- The libraries.
- The python modules. Note that, to comply with `python` restriction
  on module' names, the characters `.` and `-` are replace by `_` and
  that only the first level modules are affected.
- The directories in the `share` folder.

The headers are installed in a subforder named `TFEL-${TVEL_VERSION}`.

For example, if the `TFEL` version is `3.0.2-dev`, using
`TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` opion will generate:

- The `mfront-3.0.2-dev` executable.
- The `libTFELMaterial-3.0.2-dev.so` library.
- The `mtest_3_0_2_dev` `python` module.
- The `tfel_3_0_2_dev.material` `python` module. In this case, the
  second level (`material`) is not affected.

This allows multiple executables to be installed in the same
directory.

### Specifying a version flavour

The `TFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR` let the user define a string that will be
used to modify the names of executables, libraries and so on (see the
previous paragraph for details).

For example, using `-DTFEL_VERSION_FLAVOUR=dbg` at the `cmake`
invocation, will generate an executable called `mfront-dbg`.

This option can be combined with the `TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` option.

### Selecting the `python` version

A specific `python` version can be selected by setting the
`Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS`, as follows:

~~~~{.bash}
cmake ../trunk/ -Denable-python-bindings=ON -DPython_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS=2.7 ...
~~~~

## Using the `configure` script

~~~~ {#building-configure .bash}
$ $srcdir/configure --enable-fortran --enable-aster --enable-tests --enable-local-castem-header --prefix=${prefix}
~~~~

This will build `TFEL` with the support of interfaces for the
[Cast3M](http://www-cast3m.cea.fr/) and
[Code-Aster](http://www.code-aster.org) finite element solvers.

Various other options can be passed to the `configure` script:

- The option `--enable-cyrano` enables the interface for the
  `Cyrano3` fuel performance code.
- To enable the mechanical behaviour interface for the ZeBuLoN finite
  element solver, one may use the `--enable-zmat
  --with-zset=$ZSETPATH` option, where `$ZSETPATH` points to the
  installation directory of the ZeBuLoN finite element solver.
- To enable the material properties interface for the
  [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) language, one may use the
  `--enable-python` option.
- To enable bindings for the [`Python`](https://www.python.org/)
  language, notably for the `MTest` tool, one may use the
  `--enable-python-bindings` option. This requires the
  [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org) to be available.

Some default compiler settings are detected by `configure`, depending on
your system. To explicitly specify the compilers to be used, one may
define one of the following variables:

- `CXX` : name of the `C++` compiler
- `CC`  : name of the `C` compiler
- `FC`  : name of the `fortran` compiler
- `F77` : name of the `fortran` compiler (77 standard)

For example, we can use the following command to select the
[Intel compilers suite](https://software.intel.com/en-us/c-compilers):

~~~~ {#building-configure-icpc .bash}
$ CXX=icpc CC=icc FC=ifort F77=ifort $srcdir/configure --enable-fortran --enable-aster --enable-tests --enable-local-castem-header --prefix=${prefix}
~~~~

# Building

The configuration step created a compilation environment based on the
`make` tool.

To build `TFEL` libraries and binaries, just type:

~~~~ {#building-make .bash}
$ make
~~~~

To reduce compilation times, one may want to build `TFEL` libraries
and binaries in parallel. In this case, just type:

~~~~ {#building-make-j .bash}
$ make -j X
~~~~

`X` being the number of processors available.

# Testing (optional)

`TFEL` is delivered with many unit tests (more than 500 if you are
using the `cmake` build system and all the interfaces available). To
build them and execute them, just type:

~~~~ {#building-check .bash}
$ make check
~~~~

Again, compilation time can be reduced using the `-j` option of the
`make` command.

## Building the documentation

If a valid [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org) distribution is
available, reference manuals can be build through:

~~~~ {#building-pdf .bash}
$ make doc-pdf
~~~~

If the [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) tool is
available, code source documentation can be build through:

~~~~ {#building-html .bash}
$ make doc-html
~~~~

If [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html) is build
and if you are using the `cmake` build system, the previous command
will also install a local version of the `TFEL` web site.

~~~~ {#building-website .bash}
$ make website
~~~~

All the documentation will be build with the following command:

~~~~ {#building-html .bash}
$ make doc
~~~~

# Final install

To install `TFEL` binaries and libraries in the directory pointed by
`$prefix`, just type:

~~~~ {#building-install .bash}
$ make install
~~~~

Using `cmake`, the previous command will install the documentation if
build.

If you are using the `autotools` build system, the installation of the
documentation is a separate process done by one of the following
commands:

~~~~ {#building-doc-install .bash}
$ # install the reference manual
$ make doc-pdf-install
$ # install the doxygen manual
$ make doc-html-install
$ # install all the available documentation
$ make doc-install
~~~~

Note that you can not build the `TFEL` website using the `autotools`
build system.

# A Quick installation procedure on `Ubuntu` {#sec:QuickUbuntu}

The following steps show a quick way of installing `TFEL` on `Ubuntu`
systems. The configuration described in this section only compiles the
`generic` interface, which makes suitable for use with solvers using the
[`MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport`
project](https://github.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/issues),
e.g. with `OpenGeoSys`, `FEniCS`, `MoFEM`, etc...

The compilation requires that `gcc`, `git` and `python3` are installed,
as well as the python module `numpy` and the `libboost` library to build
the `python` bindings. Those packages can be installed using:

~~~~{.sh}
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-numpy libboost-all-dev cmake g++ gfortran
~~~~

The next step is to get the `TFEL` source code:

~~~~{.sh}
$ cd <where_you_want_to_download_the_source>
$ mkdir -p TFEL && cd TFEL
$ git clone https://github.com/thelfer/tfel.git
~~~~

This will download the current development version of `TFEL`.

Then we create a `build` directory and call `ccmake`.

~~~~{.sh}
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ ccmake ../tfel
~~~~

`ccmake` allows to select various options. In this tutorial, we choose
the following options:

~~~~{.sh}
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX    ~/.local
  TFEL_APPEND_VERSION           ON
  enable-numpy-support          ON
  enable-python                 ON
  enable-python-bindings        ON
~~~~

The `TFEL_APPEND_VERSION` allows to install different versions of `TFEL`
at the same location.

Then configure twice `[c]`,`[c]` and generate `[g]`. Once done, just
type:

~~~~{.sh}
$ make
$ make install
~~~~

Finally, add the paths in your local `.bashrc` file:

~~~~{.sh}
export PATH=$PATH:~.local/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:~/.local/lib
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
~~~~

Now you can use the local `TFEL` binaries such as `mfront-X.Y.Z-dev` and
`mtest-X.Y.Z-dev` or define some
global alias names for them.
