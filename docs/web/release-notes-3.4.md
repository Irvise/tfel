The page declares the new functionalities of the 3.4 version of the
`TFEL` project.

# Known incompatibilities

## `getPartialJacobianInvert`

In previous versions, `getPartialJacobianInvert` was implemented as a
method.

This may broke the code, in the extremely unlikely case, that the call
to `getPartialJacobianInvert` was explicitly qualified as a method, i.e.
if it was preceded by the `this` pointer. Hence, the following statement
is not more valid:

~~~~{.cxx}
this->getPartialJacobianInvert(Je);
~~~~

To the best of our knowledge, no implementation is affected by this
incompatibility.

## Declaration of the offsets of the integration variables in implicit schemes

The offsets of the integration variables in implicit schemes are now
automatically declared in the `@Integrator` code block. The names of the
variables associated with those offsets may conflict with user defined
variables. See Section
@sec:mfront:releas3.4:integration_variables_offset for a description of
this new feature.

To the best of our knowledge, no implementation is affected by this
incompatibility.

# Documentation

[This
page](ExtendingStandardElastoViscoPlasticityBrick-StressCriterion.md)
describes how to extend the `TFEL/Material` library and the
`StandardElastoViscoPlasticity` brick with a new stress criterion.

# New features of the `TFEL` libraries

## New features of the `TFEL/Math` library

### Solving multiple linear systems with `TinyMatrixSolve`

~~~~{.cxx}
  tfel::math::tmatrix<4, 4, T> m = {0, 2,  0,  1,  //
                                    2, 2,  3,  2,  //
                                    4, -3, 0,  1,  //
                                    6, 1,  -6, -5};
  tfel::math::tmatrix<4, 2, T> b = {0,  0,    //
                                    -2, -12,  //
                                    -7, -42,  //
                                    6,  36};
  tfel::math::TinyMatrixSolve<4u, T>::exe(m, b);
~~~~

### The `DerivativeType` metafunction and the `derivative_type` alias

The `DerivativeType` metafunction allows requiring the type of the
derivative of a mathematical object with respect to another object.
This metafunction handles units.


For example:

~~~~{.cxx}
DerivativeType<StrainStensor, time>::type de_dt;
~~~~

declares the variable `de_dt` as the derivative of the a strain tensor
with respect to scalare which has the unit of at time.

The `derivative_type` alias allows a more concise declaration:

~~~~{.cxx}
derivative_type<StrainStensor, time> de_dt;
~~~~

> In `MFront` code blocks, the `StrainRateStensor` `typedef` is
> automatically defined, so the previous declaration is equivalent
> to:
>
> ~~~~{.cxx}
> StrainRateStensor de_dt;
> ~~~~
>
> The `derivative_type` is much more general and can be always be
> used.

### Scalar Newton-Raphson algorithm

The function `scalarNewtonRaphson`, declared in the
`TFEL/Math/ScalarNewtonRaphson.hxx` is a generic implementation of the
Newton-Raphson algorithm for scalar non linear equations. The Newton
algorithm is coupled with bisection whenever root-bracketting is
possible, which considerably increase its robustness.

This implementation handles properly `IEEE754` exceptional cases
(infinite numbers, `NaN` values), even if advanced compilers options are
used (such as `-ffast-math` under `gcc`).

#### Usage

~~~~{.cxx}
// this lambda takes the current estimate of the root and returns
// a tuple containing the value of the function whose root is searched
// and its derivative.
auto fdf = [](const double x) {
  return std::make_tuple(x * x - 13, 2 * x);
};
// this lambda returns a boolean stating if the algorithm has converged
// the first argument is the value of the function whose root is searched
// the second argument is the Newton correction to be applied
// the third argument is the current estimate of the root
// the fourth argument is the current iteration number
auto c = [](const double f, const double, const double, const int) {
  return std::abs(f) < 1.e-14;
};
// The `scalarNewtonRaphson` returns a tuple containing:
// - a boolean stating if the algorithm has converged
// - the last estimate of the function root
// - the number of iterations performed
// The two last arguments are respectively the initial guess and 
// the maximum number of iterations to be performed
const auto r = tfel::math::scalarNewtonRaphson(fdf, c, 0.1, 100);
~~~~

# New features of `MFront`

## Debugging options

A new command line option has been added to `MFront`. The `-g` option
adds standard debugging flags to the compiler flags when compiling
shared libraries.

## Improved robustness of the isotropic DSLs

The `@Flow` block can now return a boolean value in the
`IsotropicMisesCreep`, `IsotropicMisesPlasticFlow`,
`IsotropicStrainHardeningMisesCreep` DSLs.

This allows to check to avoid Newton steps leading to too high values of
the equivalent stress by returning `false`. This usually occurs if in
elastic prediction is made (the default), i.e. when the plastic strain
increment is too low.

If `false` is returned, the value of the plastic strain increment is
increased by doubling the previous Newton correction. If this happens at
the first iteration, the value of the plastic strain increment is set to
half of its upper bound value (this upper bound value is such that the
associated von Mises stress is null).

## Generic behaviours

### Add the possibility of definining the tangent operator blocks: the `@TangentOperatorBlock` and `@TangentOperatorBlocks` keywords

In version `3.3.x`, some tangent operator blocks are automatically
declared, namely, the derivatives of all the fluxes with respect to all
the gradients. The `@AdditionalTangentOperatorBlock` and
`@AdditionalTangentOperatorBlocks` keywords allowed to add tangent
operator blocks to this default set.

The `@TangentOperatorBlock` and `@TangentOperatorBlocks` allow a more fine
grained control of the tangent operator blocks available and disable the
use of the default tangent operation blocks. Hence, tangent operator
blocks that are structurally zero (for example due to symmetry
conditions) don't have to be compute any more.

## Improvements to the implicit domain specific languages

### Automatic definition of the offsets associated with integration variables{#sec:mfront:releas3.4:integration_variables_offset}

Let `X` be the name of an integration variable. The variable `X_offset`
is now automatically defined in the `@Integrator` code block. 

This variable allows a direct modification of the residual associated
with this variable (though the variable `fzeros`) and jacobian matrix
(though the variable `jacobian`).

## Improvement of the `StandardElastoViscoplasticity` brick

### Porous (visco-)plasticity

### Choice of the eigen solver for some stress criteria in the `StandardElastoviscoPlascity` brick {#sec:standardelastoviscoplascity:eigen_solver}

The `Hosford1972` and `Barlat2004` now has an `eigen_solver` option.
This option may take either one of the following values:

- `default`: The default eigen solver for symmetric tensors used in
  `TFEL/Math`. It is based on analytical computations of the eigen
  values and eigen vectors. Such computations are numerically more
  efficient but less accurate than the iterative Jacobi algorithm.
- `Jacobi`: The iterative Jacobi algorithm (see
  [@kopp_efficient_2008;@kopp_numerical_2017] for details).

#### Example

~~~~{.cxx}
@Brick StandardElastoViscoPlasticity{
  stress_potential : "Hooke" {young_modulus : 150e9, poisson_ratio : 0.3},
  inelastic_flow : "Plastic" {
    criterion : "Hosford1972" {a : 100, eigen_solver : "Jacobi"},
    isotropic_hardening : "Linear" {R0 : 150e6}
  }
};
~~~~

### Built-in convergence helpers 

#### Newton steps rejections based on the change of the flow direction between two successive estimates{#sec:inelastic_flow:cosine_check}

Some stress criteria (Hosford 1972, Barlat 2004, Mohr-Coulomb) shows
sharp edges that may cause the failure of the standard Newton algorithm,
due to oscillations in the prediction of the flow direction.

Rejecting Newton steps leading to a too large variation of the flow
direction between the new estimate of the flow direction and the
previous estimate is a cheap and efficient method to overcome this
issue. This method can be viewed as a bisectional linesearch based on
the Newton prediction: the Newton steps magnitude is divided by two if
its results to a too large change in the flow direction.

More precisely, the change of the flow direction is estimated by the
computation of the cosine of the angle between the two previous
estimates:

\[
\cos\paren{\alpha_{\tenseur{n}}}=\dfrac{\tenseur{n}\,\colon\,\tenseur{n}_{p}}{\norm{\tenseur{n}}\,\norm{\tenseur{n}}}
\]

with \(\norm{\tenseur{n}}=\sqrt{\tenseur{n}\,\colon\,\tenseur{n}}\).

The Newton step is rejected if the value of
\(\cos\paren{\alpha_{\tenseur{n}}}\) is lower than a user defined
threshold. This threshold must be in the range \(\left[-1:1\right]\),
but due to the slow variation of the cosine near \(0\), a typical value
of this threshold is \(0.99\) which is equivalent to impose that the
angle between two successive estimates is below \(8\mbox{}^{\circ}\).

##### Example

Here is an implementation of a perfectly plastic behaviour based on the
Hosford criterion with a very high exponent (\(100\)), which closely
approximate the Tresca criterion:

~~~~{.cxx}
@DSL Implicit;
@Behaviour HosfordPerfectPlasticity100;
@Author Thomas Helfer;
@Description{
  A simple implementation of a perfect plasticity
  behaviour using the Hosford stress.
};

@ModellingHypotheses{".+"};
@Epsilon 1.e-16;
@Theta 1;

@Brick StandardElastoViscoPlasticity{
  stress_potential : "Hooke" {young_modulus : 150e9, poisson_ratio : 0.3},
  inelastic_flow : "Plastic" {
    criterion : "Hosford1972" {a : 100},
    isotropic_hardening : "Linear" {R0 : 150e6},
    cosine_threshold : 0.99
  }
};
~~~~

#### Maximum equivalent stress in the `Plastic` flow {#sec:plastic_flow:maximum_equivalent_stress}

During the Newton iterations, the current estimate of the equivalent
stress \(\sigmaeq\) may be significantly higher than the elastic limit
\(R\). This may lead to a divergence of the Newton algorithm.

One may reject the Newton steps leading to such high values of the
elastic limit by specifying a relative threshold denoted \(\alpha\),
i.e. if \(\sigmaeq\) is greater than \(\alpha\,\cdot\,R\). A typical
value for \(\alpha\) is \(1.5\). This relative threshold is specified by
the `maximum_equivalent_stress_factor` option.

In some cases, rejecting steps may also lead to a divergence of the
Newton algorithm, so one may specify a relative threshold \(\beta\) on
the iteration number which desactivate this check, i.e. the check is
performed only if the current iteration number is below
\(\beta\,\cdot\,i_{\max{}}\) where \(i_{\max{}}\) is the maximum number
of iterations allowed for the Newton algorithm. A typical value for
\(\beta\) is \(0.4\). This relative threshold is specified by the
`equivalent_stress_check_maximum_iteration_factor` option.

##### Example

    maximum_equivalent_stress_factor : 1.5,

  }
};
~~~~

### The `StandardStressCriterionBase` and `StandardPorousStressCriterionBase` base class to  ease the extension of the `StandardElastoViscoPlasticity` brick



### The `Power` isotropic hardening rule{#sec:power_isotropic_hardening_rule}

The `Power` isotropic hardening rule is defined by:
\[
R\paren{p}=R_{0}\,\paren{p+p_{0}}^{n}
\]

#### Options

The `Power` isotropic hardening rule expects at least the following
material properties:

- `R0`: the coefficient of the power law
- `n`: the exponent of the power law

The `p0` material property is *optional* and generally is considered a
numerical parameter to avoir an initial infinite derivative of the power
law when the exponent is lower than \(1\).

#### Example

The following code can be added in a block defining an inelastic flow:

~~~~{.cpp}
    isotropic_hardening : "Linear" {R0 : 50e6},
    isotropic_hardening : "Power" {R0 : 120e6, p0 : 1e-8, n : 5.e-2}
~~~~

## Improvement of the `generic` interface

## Support of orthotropic behaviours

Orthotropic behaviours requires to:

- rotate the gradients in the material frame in the global frame before
  the behaviour integration.
- rotate the thermodynamic forces and the tangent operator blocks from
  the material frame in the global frame.

By design, the `generic` behaviour interface does not automatically
perform those rotations as part of the behaviour integration but
generates additional functions to do it. This choice allows the calling
solver to use their own internal routines to handle the rotations
between the global and material frames.

However, the `generic` interface also generates helper functions which
can perform those rotations. Those functions are named as follows:

- `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateGradients`
- `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateThermodynamicForces`
- `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateTangentOperatorBlocks`

They all take three arguments: 

- a pointer to the location where the rotated variables will be stored.
- a pointer to the location where the original variables are stored.
- a pointer to the rotation matrix from the global frame to the material
  frame. The rotation matrix has 9 components stored in column-major
  format. For the function handling the thermodynamic forces and the
  tangent operators blocks, this rotation matrix is transposed
  internally to get the rotation matrix from the material frame to the
  global frame.

In place rotations is explicitly allowed, i.e. the first and second
arguments can be a pointer to the same location.

The three previous functions works for an integration point. Three other
functions are also generated:

- `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateArrayOfGradients`
- `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateArrayOfThermodynamicForces`
- `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateArrayOfTangentOperatorBlocks`

Those functions takes an additional arguments which is the number of
integration points to be treated.

### Finite strain behaviours

Finite strain behaviours are a special case, because the returned stress
measure and the returned tangent operator can be chosen at runtime time.
A specific rotation function is generated for each supported stress
measure and each supported tangent operator.

Here is the list of the generated functions:

-
  `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateThermodynamicForces_CauchyStress`.
  This function assumes that its first argument is the Cauchy stress in
  the material frame.
-
  `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateThermodynamicForces_PK1Stress`.
  This function assumes that its first argument is the first
  Piola-Kirchhoff stress in the material frame.
-
  `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateThermodynamicForces_PK2Stress`.
  This function assumes that its first argument is the second
  Piola-Kirchhoff stress in the material frame.
  `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateTangentOperatorBlocks_dsig_dF`.
  This function assumes that its first argument is the derivative of the
  Cauchy stress with respect to the deformation gradient in the material
  frame.
-
  `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateTangentOperatorBlocks_dPK1_dF`.
  This function assumes that its first argument is the derivative of the
  first Piola-Kirchhoff stress with respect to the deformation gradient
  in the material frame.
-
  `<behaviour_function_name>_<hypothesis>_rotateTangentOperatorBlocks_PK2Stress`.
  This function assumes that its first argument is the derivative of the
  second Piola-Kirchhoff stress with respect to the Green-Lagrange
  strain in the material frame.

# New features in `MTest`

## Import behaviour parameters

The behaviour parameters are now automatically imported in the behaviour
namespace with its default value.

For example, the `YoungModulus` parameter of the `BishopBehaviour` will
be available in the `BishopBehaviour::YoungModulus` variable.

This feature is convenient for building unit tests comparing the
simulated results with analytical ones.

The list of imported parameters is displayed in `debug` mode.

## Unicode characters in `MTest`

Usage of a limited subsets of `UTF-8` characters in variable names is
now allowed. This subset is described here:

<http://tfel.sourceforge.net/unicode.html>

# New features of the `python` bindings

## Improvements of the `tfel.math` module

### `NumPy` support

This version is the first to use `Boost/NumPy` to provide interaction
with `NumPy` array.

> **Note**
>
> The `NumPy` support is enabled by default if the `Python` bindings
> are requested. However, beware that `Boost/NumPy` is broken for
> `Python3` up to version 1.68. We strongly recommend disabling
> `NumPy` support when using previous versions of `Boost` by
> passing the flag `-Denable-numpy-support=OFF` to the `cmake`
> invokation.

### Exposing acceleration algorithm

The `FAnderson` and `UAnderson` acceleration algorithms are now
available in the `tfel.math` module. This requires `NumPy` support.

#### Example of the usage of the `UAnderson` acceleration algorithm

The following code computes the solution of the equation
\(x=\cos\paren{x}\) using a fixed point algorithm.

~~~~{.python}
from math import cos
import numpy as np
import tfel.math

# The accelerator will be based on
# the 5 last Picard iterations and
# will be performed at every step
a = tfel.math.UAnderson(5,1)

f = lambda x: np.cos(x)
    
x0 = float(10)
x = np.array([x0])    

# This shall be called each time a
# new resolution starts
a.initialize(x)
for i in range(0,100):
    x = f(x)
    print(i, x, f(x[0]))
    if(abs(f(x[0])-x[0])<1.e-14):
        break
    # apply the acceleration
    a.accelerate(x)
~~~~

Without acceleration, this algorithm takes \(78\) iterations. In
comparison, the accelerated algorithm takes \(9\) iterations.

# `tfel-unicode-filt`

Version 3.3 introduces unicode support in `MFront`. This feature
significantly improves the readability of `MFront` files, bringing it
even closer to the mathematical expressions.

When generating `C++` sources, unicode characters are mangled, i.e.
translated into an acceptable form for the `C++` compiler. This mangled
form may appears in the compiler error message and are difficult to
read.

The `tfel-unicode-filt` tool, which is similar to the famous `c++filt`
tool, can be use to demangle the outputs of the compiler.

For example, the following error message:

~~~~{.bash}
$ mfront --obuild  --interface=generic ThermalNorton.mfront
Treating target : all
In file included from ThermalNorton-generic.cxx:33:0:
ThermalNorton.mfront: In member function ‘bool tfel::material::ThermalNorton<hypothesis, Type, false>::computeConsistentTangentOperator(tfel::material::ThermalNorton<hypothesis, Type, false>::SMType)’:
ThermalNorton.mfront:147:75: error: ‘tum_2202__tum_0394__tum_03B5__eltum_2215__tum_2202__tum_0394__T’ was not declared in this scope
~~~~

can be significantly improved by `tfel-unicode-filt`:

~~~~{.bash}
$ mfront --obuild  --interface=generic ThermalNorton.mfront 2>&1 | tfel-unicode-filt
Treating target : all
In file included from ThermalNorton-generic.cxx:33:0:
ThermalNorton.mfront: In member function ‘bool tfel::material::ThermalNorton<hypothesis, Type, false>::computeConsistentTangentOperator(tfel::material::ThermalNorton<hypothesis, Type, false>::SMType)’:
ThermalNorton.mfront:147:75: error: ‘∂Δεel∕∂ΔT’ was not declared in this scope
~~~~
